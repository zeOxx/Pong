## PYNG!
Pong clone created with pyGame.

Features include:
- Two players!
- No AI!
- Scoring!
- Restarting the game (R)
- Ball speed increases as the game goes on!
- FUN!


The game is effectively finished, though A LOT could be improved / added. This was just a fun 4-5 hour thing for me so it's highly unlikely I'll ever revisit it.
Thanks for checking it out!
